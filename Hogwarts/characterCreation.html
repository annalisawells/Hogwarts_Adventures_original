				<h2>#1 Attributes</h2>
				<h5>
				These reflect your characters quantified innate physical and mental abilities. Each starting attribute has a score. 10 is considered average, and the higher you go the cooler you are! </h6>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Strength:</strong> your ability to exert force and do damage physically</li>
					<li><strong>Dexterity:</strong> coordination, dexterousness, and deftness, such as your speed and reflexes: your ability to avoid being hit by a Bludger and like dangers.</li>
					<li><strong>Consitution:</strong> vigor, stamina, and health; including, but not limited to your toughness, your ability to withstand pain, to throw off the effects of poison or sickness, to resist heat or cold, etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Intelligence:</strong>  your character's memory, capacity for clear and reasoned thought, intelligence, and store of basic knowledge</li>
					<li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> your strength of will: your ability to stave off fear and domination and to remain true to yourself and your word, regardless of blandishments or torture; also: your common sense and insight: your ability to determine which is true, or the best course of action, or what others feel or believe</li>
					<li><strong>Charisma:</strong> your character's force of personality, presence, and ability to inspire feelings such as awe, fear, or courage</li>
					<li><strong>**Magic:**</strong> the ability to cast spells properly, whether nautally gifted or through hard work and studying intently.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>How to calculate your attribute scores:</strong> <span>RANDOM: Roll 4d6, discard the lowest die result, and add the three remaining results together. Record this total and repeat the process until SEVEN numbers are generated. Assign these totals to your ability scores as you see fit (typically, the highest two will go towards your favored attributes)</span>
				<br><br><span> In the case that you try this random method and it gives you very sad scores, feel free to use the BUY method instead: Start with a 10 for each ability score, and distribute 12 points   <em>(1-to-1 ratio, so if you add 2 points to Dexterity, you will have a Dex score of 12 and have a remaining 10 other points to spend)</em> amongst them as you see fit. Don't bother to save any, as you cannot use them later!</span>
